I wirite this document is for the sake of learning and practicing vim using skills.

# Chapter 1: Movement without Mouse

Within a line, quickly move the cursor to the beginning and end of the line.

1. I can use `0` to get to the beginning and `&` to get to the end.
2. If I wantto get to the beginning of a line of text, use `^`.
3. Use 'f {n}' to jump back to the first {n} character.
